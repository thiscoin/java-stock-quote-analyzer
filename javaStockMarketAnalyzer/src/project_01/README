 # the project has 4 classes:
 1. Datahandler
 2. Quicksort
 3. Bubblesort
 4. MyDate
 5. DataHandlerRun
 
 
 #  To run the project you have to run DataHandlerRun class
 
 #  In order to run the project you need the following:
 
 1. Replace prices variable with the path of your prices file
 
   ex: C:\\Users\\Simeon\\Dropbox\\APPLICATIONS\\SUMMER_HW\\prices.csv (on windows)
       /Users/Simeon/Dropbox/APPLICATIONS/SUMMER_HW/prices.csv (mac/linux)
       
 2. Replace corrections variable with the path of your corrections file  
 
 3. Replace fOutput variable with the path of where you would like to save results.txt file
 
 4. Choose a window size that is less than the size of the selected date range(e.g., window =10)
 
 5. This method takes sorting method specification of QuickSort or BubbleSort,
    and sort preference-ascending or descending, and price or date as parameters.
    e.g.: List<DataHandler> dh = dataHand.loadPriceData(prices, "QUICKSORT", "ASC", "DATE");
    
 6. You can change or select dates from part 4 in the DataHandlerRun class:
 	Example: ( fromDate, toDate)
	MyDate dateForPriceSelection = new MyDate("08/15/2004", "08/20/2004");# Load Price selection
	MyDate dateForAverage = new MyDate("08/15/2004", "09/15/2004");# Date selection range for computing average 
	MyDate dateForMaximuPrice = new MyDate("04/15/2004", "06/15/2004"); # Date selection range for computing maximum value
	MyDate dateForMovAv = new MyDate("08/15/2004", "09/15/2004");# Date selection range for computing simple moving average
		
7. "DONE" message is displayed on console once the program is finished running.
